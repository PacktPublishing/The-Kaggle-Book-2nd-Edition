# Chapter 1: Introducing Kaggle and Other Data Science Competitions

This introductory chapter discusses how data science competition platforms have risen and how they work for both competitors and the institutions that run them. It specifically refers to the compelling **Common Task Framework (CTF)** paradigm discussed by Professor David Donoho. The chapter illustrates the workings of Kaggle, mentions other notable competition platforms, and details how the different competition stages work. It also covers how competitions differ and what resources the Kaggle platform offers. The overall purpose of the book is to provide a guide on how to compete better on Kaggle and extract the maximum possible from competition experiences, focusing on professional growth.
