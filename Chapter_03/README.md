# Chapter 3: Working and Learning with Kaggle Notebooks

This chapter explores **Kaggle Notebooks**, which are free-to-use Jupyter notebooks in the browser that provide a powerful environment for exploring data, building models, and submitting to competitions. Key topics include setting up and running a notebook and using it as a utility script. The chapter details how to maximize resource usage, noting that CPU and GPU sessions have **12 hours of execution time** (TPU sessions have 9 hours), plus 20 GB of auto-saved disk space. It also covers upgrading to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and leveraging notebooks as a component of a data science portfolio, noting that notebooks are indexed by Google. Finally, it highlights the value of **Kaggle Learn** courses, such as Intro to ML, Intermediate ML, Game AI, and AI Ethics.
