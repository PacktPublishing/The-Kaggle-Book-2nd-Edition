# Chapter 11: Modeling for Computer Vision

This chapter provides an overview of essential topics related to computer vision in Kaggle competitions. It begins with **augmentation strategies** (offline or online) used to extend the generalization capabilities of algorithms, highlighting Keras's built-in functionality and the Albumentations package. It demonstrates end-to-end pipelines for three frequently encountered problems: image classification (using models like EfficientNet B0), object detection (using frameworks like YOLOv5), and semantic segmentation (using frameworks like Detectron2 and handling Run-Length Encoding). It emphasizes practical considerations like the 9-hour runtime limit on Code competitions.
