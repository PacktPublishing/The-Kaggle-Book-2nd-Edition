# Chapter 12: Modeling for NLP

This chapter covers natural language processing (NLP) problems. It demonstrates the construction of pipelines for sentiment attribution (e.g., using DistilBERT embeddings) and open domain question answering (Q&A). The chapter illustrates feature engineering techniques, including the extraction of simple summary statistics ("vintage" features), generating embeddings from pre-trained models like the Universal Sentence Encoder, and using TF-IDF representations. It discusses using validation schemes like **GroupKFold** to prevent information leakage when one question has multiple answers. Finally, it details text augmentation strategies, covering basic techniques like synonym replacement and the use of the `nlpaug` package.
