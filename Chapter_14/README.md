# Chapter 14: Simulation and Optimization Competitions

This chapter addresses the class of contests where the competitor must develop a competitive agent, requiring more dynamic characteristics than traditional supervised learning. It demonstrates solutions to simulation competitions, starting with Connect X using heuristics, and discussing agent creation for Rock, Paper, Scissors. Solutions often involve algorithmic approaches like the **Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)** problem (such as using Thompson Sampling with Beta distribution).
